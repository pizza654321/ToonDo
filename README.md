# ToonDo
ToonDo is a web app that motivates users to complete their to-do lists through the care of their digital pet Toon. The idea is to leverage the [Tamagotchi effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi_effect) in order to reinvent the often dull and daunting to-do list.

This project was built for CSC 431: Introduction to Software Engineering at the University of Miami.
